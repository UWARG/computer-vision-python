GMM Seems to have difficulty limiting the number of detected clusters with a low standard deviation
-Consider checking detected clusters for presence of points within certain radius (size of landing pad * 1.5 or *2?)
    >If must return all landing pad locations -> gg, try blowing up the data or some shit idk, rework parameters
    >If only need return single landing pad location -> return one with most points within radius
    >If must return multiple but not all -> return ones with points above certain threshold
        >Can consider this even if minimum 1 - drone flying efficiency
        >Average
        >67%


Run tests on better representative data
-Manually spread out by cluster
-Units of metres


500x500m area?
Landing pad radius =  0.4064m


Leave mean prior sample alone ig


Use vstack to do the funny landing pad simulation separation thing



Cleaning/determine:
iterate through points
    iterate through clusters
        if outside of any landing pad radius * 3 centred on clusters, remove data point (consider false positive)
        if inside of any landing pad radius * 0.75, attach to cluster

return cluster with highest number of attached points
consider running VGMM again on attached points
