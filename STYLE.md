# Coding Style Guide

This is the style guide for CV, following [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and [Pylint](https://pylint.org/). Follow this guide for all new code (you do not need to worry about old code). Use common sense and/or mention @Xierumeng on Discord if there is something that needs clarification.

## Pylint

Pylint can either be installed as a [Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.pylint) or through `pip` . Fix lint issues before asking for review, as otherwise the PR might get delayed as the reviewer will ask you to resolve those issues before it can be merged.

If a lint issue cannot be resolved by restructuring code, Pylint can be disabled for a specific line with:

```python
# Explanation for disabling the linter
# pylint: disable=[problem-code]
stuff
# pylint: enable=[problem-code]
```

Where `[problem-code]` is the descriptive version (e.g. use `import-error` rather than `E0401` ).

All Pylint disables MUST be accompanied by a comment explaining why this is necessary. The disabled section must be as short as possible.

## Basics

Here are the basics, and there is an example in [General](#general) below.

* `variable_names` in snake_case

* `function_names()` in snake_case

* `ClassNames` in PascalCase (UpperCamelCase)

* `CONSTANT_NAMES` in CAPITAL_SNAKE_CASE

* `file_names` in snake_case

* Private members (methods and attributes) have two underscores to indicate them as such:
    * `def __my_private_func():` and `__my_private_set = set()`

* Initialize any variables within class constructor to `None` or some other value
    * Class members are ONLY be created in the constructor

* Use constants for numbers that can be tweaked (e.g. pixel height/pixel width of an image, number of epochs in a model)

* 4 spaces per level of indentation

* No space before an opening parantheses:
    * Use `my_function(myVar)` NOT `my_function (myVar)`

* Only use parantheses when necessary:
    * `while myInt < 3:` NOT `while (myInt < 3):`

* Operators:
    * No spaces around `*` , `/` , `%` , `!`
    * No spaces around `:` if it's used as a slicing operator, otherwise use spaces:
        * Slicing operator: `[1:]` and `[:, 2:4]`
    * One space on either side of `=`, `==`, `+`, `-`, `+=`, `-=`, etc
        * Except in named arguments of a function call (e.g. `np.sum(arr, axis=1)` )
    * One space after every comma: `my_func(var1, var2, var3)`
        * Slicing: `[:3, :]`

* 100 character limit per line

## Files

Module/file names are in snake_case: `geolocation_worker.py`

File contents end with 1 blank line:

```python
stuff
# Last blank line below, then end of file

```

Indents are 4 spaces long. Blank lines do not have any spaces. Strings are encoded with UTF-8 and enclosed with **double quotes**.

## Imports

Import order:

1. System-level modules: Anything that comes with Python by default
2. Installed modules: Anything that requires `pip install`
3. Local modules: Anything written by/for WARG (including submodules)

Separate each group of imports with 1 blank line, with module names in alphabetical order within the group:

```python
import os
import sys

from math import pi
import numpy as np

import modules.geolocation
```

**No wildcards (asterisk/star) in `from` imports**. Explicitly state what needs to be imported.

```python
from typing import *  # NO
from typing import Tuple  # Okay
```

Do not call private functions or variables from an imported module:

```python
import some_cv_module

some_cv_module.__some_private_function()  # NO
some_cv_module.ClassName.__private_member  # NO
```

## General

It's easier to show by example for reference than giving a bunch of forgettable rules:

```python
import os
import sys
import time
from typing import Dict
from typing import List
from typing import Tuple

from math import pi
import numpy as np

import geolocation
import geolocation_worker


# Top-level constants are in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
# Do not use top-level mutables (all top-level variables are constants ONLY)
UPPER_SNAKE_CASE = True
# 1 space after the octothorpe/number sign/hash in a comment
GLOBAL_CONST = 5  # 2 spaces before an inline comment
# 2 blank lines between top-level imports, constants, function definitions, and class definitions


# Types from other modules include the prefix (e.g. `np.ndarray` ), except from the typing module
# Containers (e.g. list, dict, tuple, set) include the type of the enclosed objects
def get_coordinates(new_frame: np.ndarray=np.zeros((416, 416, 3))) \
                    -> Dict[yolov2_assets.utils.BoundBox, Tuple[int, int]]:
    """
    Function, method, and variable names are in snake_case.
    Function and method parameters have type hints where possible.

    Every function, class, and method has a docstring below the signature (NOT above):

    * Provide a short description of what the function/method/class does.
    * End each sentence in a docstring with punctuation (period, colon, etc.).
    * Docstring text on a new line (triple quotes are by themselves on a separate line).

    Optionally, add additional documentation:

    1. Description of what the function does.

    2. A list of parameters, including name, type, whether it is optional,
    and a description of the parameter.

    3. The function's return type (if any), as well as a description of what it returns.

    In general, the code itself should be easy to follow so that not much documentation is required.

## Multiline

Function and method definitions (calls have a different style below):

```python
def example_function(arg0: int, arg1: int,
                     arg2: int, arg3: int,
                     arg4: int):
    """
    Example.
    """
    pass
```

Conditionals and loops use parantheses:

```python
if (condition0 and
    condition1):
    # Required comment for separation of condition and body
    pass

while (conditio0 and
       condition1):
    # Required comment for separation of loop and body
    pass
```

Backslash: At the end of the line, 1 space followed by backslash:

```python
# Any required string encoding uses UTF-8
with open("/path/to/some/file/you/want/to/read", encoding="utf-8") as file_1, \
     open("/path/to/some/file/being/written", "w", encoding="utf-8") as file_2:
    pass
```

Everything else:

```python
example0 = example_function(
    0, 1,
    2, 3,
    4
)

example1 = dict(
    name0 = [
        [0, 0],
        [1, 1],
        [2, 2]
    ],
    name1 = [
        [3, 3]
    ]
)

example2 = [
    ["h"],
    [
        [0, 0],
        set("hi", "hie", "fie"),
        dict(
            a = 1,
            b = 2
        )
    ],
    []
]
```

# Suggestions

## Exceptions

Avoid throwing and catching exceptions, as it is very slow. Instead, use return checking:

```python
def possibly_failing_function(num: int) -> Tuple[bool, int]:
    """
    Fails if num is zero.
    """
    if num == 0:
        return False, None

    # Do some stuff
    return True, 3 / num


values = []
for i in range(-5, 5 + 1):  # + 1 indicates end value of 5 is inclusive
    result, value = possibly_failing_function(i)
    if not result:
        continue

    values.append(value)
```

## Pythonic

Follow a Pythonic style of coding if possible. For example:

Iterating:

```python
file_names = [
    "a",
    "b",
    "c",
    "d"
]

for file_name in file_names:
    print(file_name)  # This will print `a`, then `b`, then `c`, etc.
```

Slicing and matrix multiplication:

```python
# 3x2 array
a = np.array(
    [
        [1, 1],
        [2, 3],
        [5, 8]
    ]
)

a_sum_columns = a.sum(axis=0)
# array([8, 12])

a_sum_rows = a.sum(axis=1)
# array([2, 5, 13])

a_sum_all0 = a.sum()
# 20

a_sum_all1 = a.sum(axis=None)
# 20

# @ is the matrix multiplication operator
a @ a_sum_columns
# array([20, 52, 136])

# Get column 1
a[:, 1]
# array([1, 3, 8])
```

Zipping:

```python
my_keys = ["C", "V", "P"]
my_values = [3, 5, 0]

dict(zip(my_keys, my_values))
# Dict[str, int]: {"C": 3, "V": 5, "P": 0}
```
